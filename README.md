## What is En2Deux

A collaborative work with Laurent M. and Agash J. made for the 2nd project of Ironhack. 

For those who have organized events with their friends, family or collegues,
We know how much it is a struggle to make sure you satisfy everyone's demands.
They never have the same plannings or budgets, some take a long time to answer ...etc ðŸ¤¯

Thus, that is exactly why we created En Deux-Deux !



## About Implementations:

This implementation uses the following:
   - A document based database hosted on MongoDB on Atlas
   - JWT for authentication
   - Hekoru for deployment 



## Data model

- Event (created by a user)
- Attendee (user attending to an event)

Then he invites friends to join event and they'll vote for the best option.
